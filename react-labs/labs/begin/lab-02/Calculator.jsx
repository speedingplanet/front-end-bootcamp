/*
Select an operator from a drop-down. Pass the selected operator
into CalculatorDisplay.

Use the useState hook to initialize the operator

Write an event handler, `handleSwitch` which takes an event as an argument
and calls the setter you configured in your useState call

Add a <select> list above CalculatorDisplay. The options should be
- "Choose" / value is the empty string
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Don't forget to update the `onChange` and `value` attributes of the select list
to make it a controlled component (controlled by `handleSwitch` above)

Pass the value you used for the operator in your useState hook into
CalculatorDisplay as the `operator` property
