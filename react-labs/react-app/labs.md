## Improving the Navbar

Don't use the NavbarChildren version. At least not yet.

- Add a click event handler to each of the <li> elements in NavBar.
- The event handler should use the `navigate` function to navigate to the appropriate URL
- It's fine to hard-code the URL values into the event handlers
- Getting the destination URL programmatically might be more complicated

## User details

Clicking on a Sender or Recipient sends us to the UserDetails via routing

We need the user id
We need to map that to some user details (data/users.json)
UserDetails component
Pass the details to UserDetails and the component displays said details
Need a route configuration and url for user details
/zippay/user/[user id goes here]

Does UserDetails get full user details or does it get a userId and look it up in users.json?

UserDetails is given a user object and renders it. Some parent/container/controller component does the lookup work.

<UserDetailsLookup>
  <UserDetails>
</UserDetailsLookup>

The router routes to the parent component.
The parent component uses `useParams` to get the user id
Parent looks up the user
Hands user info to UserDetails

## Remote data for our app

- Setup:
  - Change the port number in package.json, and remember the port number
  - Make sure you have server.json in your data folder:
    - git checkout john -- data/server.json
  -     "rest-server": "json-server --port 8100 ./data/server.json",
  - Start the remote server from a terminal with npm run rest-server
- In PaymentsGrid.jsx
  - Delete the import from payments.json. No more hardcoded data
  - Add a call to useEffect!
  - The URL should be localhost:8100/payments
  - Use the fetch command
  - Feel free to use either promises or async-await, whichever style you prefer
  - DO NOT forget to add an empty dependencies array to your useEffect call:
    - useEffect(() => {}, [])
  - If you're using useEffect and async-await, look at the async-await demo. You have to define the async function first and then call it. This is different with promises.
  - Test it by loading up PaymentsGrid and seeing if you have data!

## Working with Redux

A checklist for implementing Redux. This assumes that we know what state looks like and what we want to be able to do with it.

1. What does our state look like?
2. What do we want to change about it?
3. Create a slice with reducers
4. Configure a store, with the reducer `createSlice` returns
5. Wrap the appropriate ancestor component in a `<Provider>` which has access to the store
6. Implement Redux-enabled components

### Enabling Redux for components

1. Identify props (inputs)
2. Identify events (output)
3. Map events to dispatches (component -> Redux)
4. Map props to selectors (Redux -> component)
